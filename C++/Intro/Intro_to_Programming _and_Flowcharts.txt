How to solve a programming problem?
1. Understand the problem. 
2. Draw a flowchart. (Check the given values)
3. Write pseudocode. (Figure out an approach)
4. Write code. 
5. Test code.

Given some problem P, say you 'think' of some solution, ki aise aise krenge, etc. Now write down this crude solution on paper, 
not necessarily in correct syntax (code ki bhasha). Now your idea is on paper. Convert this rough work, also called 'pseudocode'
into a program in a programming lang. usage of your choice, say C++.

Pseudocode: A very simple and high-level (upar-upar ka) form of computer langage that is used in program design.

A Flowchart is diagramatic representation of an approach. This draws out all the steps of your approach in order.

Components of a flowchart:
    1. Terminator: Specifies the start and end of the flowchart.
    2. Parallelogram:For taking input or showing output.
    3. Process: Operations and processes ke liye.
    4. Decision: Decision making.
    5. Circle: Connectors.
    6. Arrow: Connects the components.


Pseudocode for adding 2 numbers:

    input 2 numbers a and b
    let sum = a + b
    print out sum
    
    or

    read a and b
    sum variable is a+b
    sum chaapo

Both pseudocodes are ok. No pseudocode is wrong as long as the logic is same/similar.

What is a Programming Language?

    Jaise khana khane ke liye mummy/papa ko bolna padhta hai, vaise hi we must instruct our computer to perform some task for us.

    More formally, a programming language is a way to communicate with a computer.
    It is a formal language which consist of set of strings that produce various kinds of machine output.

    E.g. C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.

    C++ program to display "Hello World"
 
    //Header file for input output functions
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
 
    //Main() function: where the execution of program begins
    int main()
    {
        //prints hello world
        cout << "Hello World";
        return 0;
    }
    
    Every language must be written following some rules called syntax of that language.

    A computer essentially only understands binary codes of 0s and 1s.
    A compiler processes the statements of a programming language into Machine Code (Binary).

    Source Code --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> Executable Code (.exe)
